- Union modifiers

  - assigning multiple types to the variable using `|` a `with a single pipe symbol instead of 2 which is a regular or operator`
  - can also be assigned a specific value for type if those are the only type values you need.
  - You can declare type inside a type which is a union of different types.

- Intersection modifier
  - Can be done using `&`.
  - Usually done when you want to add things to a specific type which is already defined.
  - If you want to do this with interface you can do it using `extends` keyword.
  - Also can be done with a combination as well.
  - Can be done with multiple not limited to 2
  - Intersection doesn't work with primitive types.
