## By Web Dev Simplified

### Notes

- To initialize a typescript project you need to install typescript as the dev dependency
- Then you have to setup the tsconfig file by using the command `npx tsc --init`
- Compile the typescript file by running the command `npx tsc script.ts`
- If your code has a error it gives the console error, and if you want output not to be displayed if there is an error `npx tsc script.ts --noEmitOnError`
