/* Two ways to assign the data either as follows below */
let a: number = 10;
let b = 1; // These both methods will have numeber property assigned to the variable a and b
/* Cannot assign wrong type of data */
// a = "abc";
// b = null;

/* For const */
const x = "abc";
// x = "def";
/* cannot assign anything to the constant variable. as it gets the property of the value */

/* null and undefined are different same like javascript */
// let var1: undefined = null;
// let var2: null = undefined;

/* Any Type - by default in JS all variables are any and we don't get any protectio */

let var1: any = "aditya";
